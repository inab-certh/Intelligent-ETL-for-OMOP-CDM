To confirm, here's an example of how the workflow might look:

    You provide the first JSON object with id = 0, which represents the beginning of the SQL file.
    I generate the SQL code for section 0 based on the JSON object.
    You provide the next JSON object with id = 1, which represents the next section of the SQL file.
    I generate the SQL code for section 1 based on the JSON object and append it to the existing SQL file.
    If there's an issue with the generated code for section 1, I can use the edit_sql_file function to edit that specific section.
    The process continues until all JSON objects have been processed and the complete SQL file has been generated.

Is that a correct understanding of the workflow?

Also, I have a few questions to clarify the JSON structure:

    What is the purpose of the output_type property? Is it used to determine whether to generate a view or an insert statement?
    Can you provide more information about the transform property in the mappings and columns sections? What kind of transformations are supported?
    How do the joins and filters properties work together to define the join logic?
    Can you provide more information about the primary_key property? How is it used to generate the primary key for the target table?
